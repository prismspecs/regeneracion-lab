    </div>

    <article class="article-content">
        <p>The Regeneración Lab is grounded in the rebellious political concept of regeneración that emerged in the late
            nineteenth century and inspired the 1910 Mexican revolution. Our work centers community-based research
            justice, creative-critical practices, media, and decolonial praxis.</p>

        <h3>Why Regeneración?</h3>

        <p>We are named after the anarchist newspaper Regeneración, published by the Flores Magón brothers from
            1900-1918. Our lab carries forward their spirit of radical critique while centering Indigenous
            epistemologies and antiracism often erased in traditional anarchist narratives.</p>

        <p>The Regeneración newspaper, in its various formations, was the highest circulating Spanish language newspaper
            of its time, and sometimes included English and Italian language sections. It was read by hundreds of
            thousands of people across the world and often read aloud for those who were illiterate. But Regeneración
            was also part of a larger insurgent publishing network at the turn of the 20th century structured around
            community-based media, first person accounts and testimonials, investigative reporting, translation, poetry,
            fiction, plays, music, comics and print art, public speeches and street corner conversations, and early
            engagements with photography and cinema. Many of the authors included in these alternative newspapers were
            Indigenous, Black Mestizo, Feminists, Queers, Immigrants, workers, peasants, political and poverty
            prisoners, religious minorities, and other people who could not get their voices covered in mainstream
            media. Their publications were often repressed and criminalized, with authors and interviewees risking death
            or incarceration to speak truth to power. We honor their legacy in opening the door for community-based
            media through our research justice work today.</p>

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>

        <p>We create space for research, dialogue, and cultural production that challenges settler-colonial frameworks
            and imagines otherwise. Our work brings together scholars, artists, community members, and activists working
            at the intersections of Indigenous studies, ethnic studies, border politics, environmental justice, women of
            color feminisms, queer theory, and decolonial theory.</p>

        <p>We are particularly interested in archives, museums, community stories and historiographies, website and
            social media projects, film, pop ed and critical pedagogy, creative writing, mapping and cartographies, oral
            history, cultural revitalization, land and water based projects, constructing autonomy, transformative
            justice, and intergenerational work.</p>

                and literary analysis, critical geography, archival study, community-based research praxis, and the

                communities, supports resident scholars and artists, and builds educational resources for students and
