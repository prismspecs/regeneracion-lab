        <p>Collaborative project with Payómkawichum and Kumeyaay youth to recover the Indigenous place-names of the North San Diego County "Mission Trail", part of the UC Critical Mission Studies Initiative.</p>

        <h3>About the Project</h3>

        <p>This project centers the voices and knowledge of Payómkawichum (Luiseño) and Kumeyaay youth in recovering and reclaiming Indigenous place-names that have been erased or replaced by Spanish colonial mission names. Through community-based research and mapping, youth researchers worked to document the original Indigenous geographies of North San Diego County.</p>

        <p>The project challenges the dominant narrative of California's "Mission Trail" by foregrounding Indigenous histories, land relations, and ongoing presence. By recovering place-names, the project asserts Indigenous sovereignty and connection to ancestral homelands.</p>

        <h3>View the Project</h3>

        <p>The full project is available as an interactive StoryMap featuring maps, oral histories, photographs, and youth researcher reflections.</p>
