                    <p><strong>Regeneración—regeneration in Spanish—</strong>signals both a historical continuity and a
                        rupture. Named after the anarchist newspaper published by the Flores Magón brothers from
                        1900-1918, our lab carries forward their spirit of radical critique while centering Indigenous
                        epistemologies often erased in traditional anarchist narratives.</p>

                    <p>We are a research collective working at the intersections of Indigenous studies, border politics,
                        anarchist theory, and decolonial practice. Based in the Southwest but connected to networks
                        across Turtle Island and beyond, we create space for scholarship and cultural production that
                        refuses settler-colonial frameworks.</p>

                    <h3>Our Approach</h3>

                    <p>Regeneración Lab operates outside traditional academic structures. We believe knowledge
                        production should be accountable to communities, not institutions. Our work is grounded in
                        several commitments:</p>

                    <div class="quote-block">
                        "Refusal, clarity, sabotage. Photocopy spirit; networked circulation."
                    </div>

                    <p>We prioritize accessibility—all our resources are freely available. We practice citation politics
                        that center Indigenous and BIPOC scholars. We reject extractive research models. We understand
                        archives not as sites of preservation but as tools for present struggles.</p>

                    <h3>History & Context</h3>

                    <p>The lab emerged from years of organizing work, from Indigenous Action collectives to water
                        protector camps to university study groups that felt too constrained by academic conventions. We
                        wanted a space that could hold both rigorous theoretical work and urgent practical organizing—a
                        space that understood they're inseparable.</p>

                    <p>Like the original Regeneración newspaper, we believe in the power of printed—now digital—matter
                        to circulate ideas, build networks, and coordinate resistance. But we also recognize that
                        anarchism's European origins must be challenged and transformed through Indigenous critique.</p>

                    <h3>What We Do</h3>

                    <p>Our work takes many forms: hosting resident scholars and artists, developing educational
                        resources like our Indigenous Border Studies syllabus, maintaining community archives, and
                        connecting people across movements and geographies. We're not an academic department or a
                        nonprofit organization—we're a lab, a space for experimentation in decolonial thought and
                        practice.</p>
